# 🦝 Habit Tracker Frontend

This is the frontend for my full-stack habit tracking app — built in React, styled with vibes, and powered by caffeine and chaos.

## 🚀 Features

- User Signup & Login (with JWT)
- Dashboard to view and manage habits

- Backend: Express + MongoDB (see [habit-tracker-backend](link-to-backend-repo) repo)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Axios
- React Router DOM
- Custom API calls to Express backend
- Eventually styled with Tailwind (👀)

## 🧪 Getting Started

Make sure your backend is running at http://localhost:3000.
